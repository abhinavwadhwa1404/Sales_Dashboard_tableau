# Apexline Solutions – Sales Performance Dashboard

## Introduction
This project is a **Sales Performance Dashboard** built in Tableau using sample sales data. The dashboard helps to analyse sales, profit, and quantity trends over time, making it easier to track performance and spot key insights.

## How I Built It
1. **Data Connection:**  
   I connected the sales data (Excel/CSV file) to Tableau and set up **relationships** between different tables like `Orders`, `Products`, and `Regions`.  
   This allowed me to link sales, profit, and quantity data with product categories and locations.

3. **Data Cleaning:**  
   I renamed fields, added calculated fields for KPIs like **% Change in Sales/Profit** (Year-over-Year Growth), and formatted dates for monthly and weekly trends. For example, I created a calculation to highlight the minimum and maximum monthly sales, as shown below:

5. **Dashboard Design:**  
   - I first created **individual worksheets** for KPIs, trends, and subcategory comparisons.  
   - Then I combined them into a **single dashboard** with interactive filters and a clean layout.
